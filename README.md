# Travel-App :earth_africa:

Last project for **Udacity** course.<br>
Combining all the Front End skills learned into a capstone project.<br>
This project is based on Webpack, Node.js and complemented by three external API's.<br>
These API's are:<br>
* **Geonames**: geographical database that covers all countries;
* **Weatherbit**: weather data;
* **Pixabay**: image data.
